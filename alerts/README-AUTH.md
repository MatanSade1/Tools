# Quick Authentication Setup

Since gcloud authentication requires a browser session, run this one command:

```bash
./alerts/setup-gcloud-auth-one-step.sh
```

This will:
1. Set your GCP project automatically
2. Open your browser for authentication
3. Guide you through the process
4. Verify everything is set up correctly

**That's it!** After this, you can use BigQuery locally.
